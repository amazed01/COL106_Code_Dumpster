   1.3(a) :: WORST CASE TIME COMPLEXITIES

        Insert		O(1)  { Insert the element in the DLL after the current node takes constant steps }
        Delete		O(n)  { Search for the block to be deleted can take O(n) steps in worst case }
        Find		O(n)  { Search for the block can take O(n) steps in worst case }
        getFirst	O(n)  { Traversal to head may take O(n) steps in worst case }
        getNext		O(1)  { Return next element takes constant steps }
        sanity		O(n)  { Checks validity for all elements take }
